# IoT-Based-Wheelchair-Fall-Detection-Project
This wheelchair fall detection project can accurately detect wheelchair fall cases. By collecting and analyzing sensor data from accelerometers and gyroscopes mounted on the persons body, we were able to identify patterns and features that distinguish falls from normal movements. 


Objective: 
•	To detect persons accidental movement remotely.
•	To get notifications in accidental cases instantly

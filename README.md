# IoT-Based-Wheelchair-Fall-Detection-Project
This wheelchair fall detection project can accurately detect wheelchair fall cases. By collecting and analyzing sensor data from accelerometers and gyroscopes mounted on the persons body, we were able to identify patterns and features that distinguish falls from normal movements. 


# Objective: 
•	To detect persons accidental movement remotely.
•	To get notifications in accidental cases instantly


# Background Theory:
Wheelchairs are usually used by people of old age. With maturity, weak bones and weakness because of alternative health connected problems could lead to increase risk of falling. A supervisor might not continually be on the market with them and if correct assistance is not provided at the correct time it would cause larger health considerations which will need extra resources for treatment. For this purpose we've projected a wise IOT Based Wheelchair Fall detection Project that uses sensors and  reports these incidents to assist  at the correct time to forestall additional injury to health. Worry of dropping would possibly scale back physical activities leading to declining social interactions and eventually resulting in depression. When it involves maturity, it becomes necessary to observe our recent ones for his or her health and safety. Our system uses accelerometer and gyro sensor to detect person movements, It can be mounted on persons hand or wheelchair for detection. The sensor is connected to a microcontroller in order to constantly transmit the acceleration data. Now the system keeps monitoring for fall detection and abrupt movement changes in person. A sudden abrupt change with jerk in the system is treated as a fall. Now in case the person did not fall and alarm was false, the system allows to snooze the alert if person presses snooze button in 5 seconds. If person does not press the snooze, system detects person has fallen and automatically triggers alert through WIFI connection to alert the loved ones of the person about the situation instantly.
